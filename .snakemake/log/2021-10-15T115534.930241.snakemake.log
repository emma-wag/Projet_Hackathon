MissingOutputException in line 9 of /home/ubuntu/Projet_Hackaton/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
SRR628586/SRR628586_2.fastq.gz
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 6 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 6
Removing output files of failed job count since they might be corrupted:
/mnt/mydatalocal/genes/SRR628586/SRR628586_2.fastq.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

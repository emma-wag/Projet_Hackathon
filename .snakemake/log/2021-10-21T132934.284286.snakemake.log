Building DAG of jobs...

Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule download_gene:
    jobid: 18
    output: /mnt/mydatalocal/chromosome/Chr18
    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job download_gene since they might be corrupted:
/mnt/mydatalocal/chromosome/Chr18
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
